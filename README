*********************** UValue version 0.1.0a ***********************

Welcome to UValue

UValue is an attempt to make a unit value that will maintain its units across the most common arithmetic operations.  In addition, I wanted something that would easily convert between like units, e.g. cm to ft.   

Enjoy.	

Usage:

To create a UValue one passes the double value along with the explicit allocation of the desired unit class.  In this example I allocate via 'new' the DistanceUnit class.  The unit class object is managed and deleted by the UValue object.  

UValue aUnitValue(0, new DistanceUnit("m"));

To convert between allowable units in a single unit class simply use the square brackets and a character string of the desired unit's symbol.

UValue aUnitValue(1, new DistanceUnit("m"));

UValue newUnitValue = aUnitValue["cm"];

cout << "New Unit: " << newUnitValue << endl;
cout << "Old Unit: " << aUnitValue << endl;

-- OUTPUT -- 

New Unit: 100 cm
Old Unit: 1 m

The unit symbols are case sensitive.  And no accounting is made for whitespaces before or after the symbol.  So be sure of your unit strings.

Outupt of the unit value is done by either the << symbol or by using the print method.
